# Forecasting
Forecasting the monthly sales with LSTM in Python.

# About Project
- Focus on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) method
- Use Keras(Popular machine learning library) in our project to implement LSTM.

# 3 Steps to Implement model
1. Data Wrangling
2. Data Transformation to make it stationary and supervised
3. Building the LSTM model & evaluation

## Instructions
Run 'predictingSales.py' and outputs an interactive graph titled `salesPredictions.html`
